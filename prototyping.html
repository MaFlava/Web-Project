				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<p>A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept
				or process. It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design,
				electronics, and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new 
				design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. Prototyping serves to provide 
				specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one. In some design 
				workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the 
				step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. A prototype can also mean a 
				typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation 'prototypical'. 
				This is a useful term in identifying objects, behaviours and concepts which are considered 
				the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes.

				<h2>Photoshop</h2>
				<p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for 
				Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, 
				the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in
				digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading 
				to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop
				contest") although Adobe discourages such use.[4] Photoshop can edit and compose raster 
				images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models 
				including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses its own PSD and PSB
				file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, this software has
				limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping 
				path for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by
				plug-ins; programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it
				and offer new or enhanced features. --> Wikipedia</p>
