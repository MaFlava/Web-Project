				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>Research is "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge, 
				including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge 
				to devise new applications." It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the 
				results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new
				theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research
				projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school 
				research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them
				for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments,
				research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary 
				purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, 
				interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the 
				advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary
				considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of 
				research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, 
				practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices 
				is known as meta-research. --> Wikipedia</p>

				<h2>User Testing</h2>
				<p>Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a 
				product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, 
				since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. It is more concerned with 
				the design intuitiveness of the product and tested with users who have no prior exposure 
				to it. Such testing is paramount to the success of an end product as a fully functioning 
				app that creates confusion amongst its users will not last for long. This is in contrast 
				with usability inspection methods where experts use different methods to evaluate a user 
				interface without involving users. Usability testing focuses on measuring a human-made 
				product's capacity to meet its intended purpose. Examples of products that commonly 
				benefit from usability testing are food, consumer products, web sites or web applications, 
				computer interfaces, documents, and devices. Usability testing measures the usability, or 
				ease of use, of a specific object or set of objects, whereas general humanâ€“computer 
				interaction studies attempt to formulate universal principles. --> Wikipedia</p>
