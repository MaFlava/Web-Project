				<h2>HTML</h2>
				<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed
				to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
				Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML 
				documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
				web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included 
				cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML 
				pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
				embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
				denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
				and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags 
				such as  img  and  input  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
				 p  surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as 
				sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content 
				of the page. --> Wikipedia</p>

				<h2>CSS</h2>
				<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
				presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone 
				technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable 
				the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
				separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
				specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting
				by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition
				in the structural content. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to 
				present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as 
				on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on 
				Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content 
				is accessed on a mobile device. --> Wikipedia</p>

				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, 
				object-oriented programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
				JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
				and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core 
				technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
				essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web 
				browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, 
				JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented 
				and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, 
				regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as 
				networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it
				is embedded to provide these features. --> Wikipedia</p>
